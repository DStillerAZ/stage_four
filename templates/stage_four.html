    <div class="information">
     <p>
      The world wide web functions by users sending Hypertext Transfer Protocol (or HTTP) 
      requests via web browser to a server. The server then interprets the request and sends the correct HTML
      document back to the web browser which interprets and displays it for the user.

    <div class="information">
     <p>
      HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the language used by the documents that form the majority of
      the content on the web. HTML contains <b>text content</b> which is <em>what</em> you see, <b>markup</b> which is <em>how</em> it looks, <b>references to other doccuments</b> such as <em>images</em>, or <em>videos</em>, and <b>links</b> to other <em> html pages.</em>

    <div class="information">
     <p>
      All HTML content is defualt interpreted as a single line (see limitations of computers). If you desire any white space you must create it with HTML tags. There are two types of linebreak tags &lt; br &gt; (break) which creates a single line break per tag (this is a void tag as it does not require a closing tag) and &lt; p &gt; (paragraph) which creates an invisible box around it's content.

      The first element in an HTML document is the document type which assigns which type of HTML the document is. In HTML5 documents this string is simply HTML. The doctype tag is followed by the opening HTML tag which, along with it's closing html tag, surround the entire document both head and body sction. Next is the head tag which can include Javascript and CSS style elements. The head tag includes the title element which defines what is displayed in the browser tab. Next is the body tag which cantains the contents of the document.

    <div class="information">
     <p>
      HTML is used to define the <b>structure</b> of a document while CSS is used to define it's <b>style</b>. The structure of a document refers to how the elements are organized, nested inside eachother, forming a tree like structure. This strucutral convention is refered to as Document Object Model or DOM. Style refers to the characteristics defined within each element that dictate things such as size, font, color etc.

     Within a browser (in this case Goolge Chrome) there exist developer tools which allow you to inspect and edit the code used to generate a web page. You can hover over a specific HTML element to highlight the object on the page for ease of use. You can also use the "inspect object" feature to find the code within the doucument that produced a specific object on the page.

      CSS
      </div>
    <div class="information">
     <p>
     CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language used to define the layout and style elements of a web page. CSS helps you to avoid repitious work throught the concept of inheritence. Properties alpplied to a parent element will be inherited by it's descendants. Not all properties can be inhertied. Text properties such as color or faont are inherited while box properties like border or padding are not.

    <div class="information">
     <p>
     Every element on a web page is a box. Each box is made up of four elements: 
             <br> The content which is the text or image
              <br> The padding wich is effected by the background color of the content and clears an area around said content. 
              <br> The border which goes around the content and padding and is inherited by the color property of the box 
              <br> The margin which clears an area around the border. The margine has no background color
                The size of an element is equal to the totoal width of it's content, padding, border and margin

     <p>
     The CSS property box-sizing: boder-box; makes the calculation of the element size inclue the border, padding and content so that the element's size needn't be recalculated each time you make an adjustment. Margin is not included in that calculation but remains the same no matter how much you tweak the border, padding or content. When using this recently developed property you must include browser specific prefixes to ensure proper display in all browsers.

    <div class="information">
      <p>
        The width of an element can be adjusted by both pixels or a percetnage. If you define the value in pixels the element will not change and adapt with screnn size, however if you define it as a percentage it will expand or contract with screen size to remain at a constant proportion.</p>

      Computer Science and Programming 
      </div>
    <div class="information">
     <p>
     Computer science, as defined by wikipedia, is "the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications.". Programming is the core of computer science. Without programs a computer can do absolutely nothing. A program tells a computer a very specific set of steps to take.

      Getting Started with Python
      </div>
    <div class="information">
     <p>
     Python is a computer language. It differs from a natural or spoken language in that it lacks ambiguity. Instead of a grammar that allows for interpretation and nuance computer languages ensure that the same expression equates to the same meaning every time to every user.

      Variables in Python
    </div>
    <div class="information">
     <p>
     In Python varaibles are used to quickly and clearly refer to a value. For example, instead of typing out the numerical value 299792458 you could asign that value to the variable name speed_of_light. To assign a value to a variable one simply uses the equals sign. The string speed_of_light = 299792458 tells the Python interpreter to assign that numerical value to that variable name and the name can then be used in place of the numerical value. In mathematics the equals sign is used to denote that, that one thing equals another, but in Python it denotes assignment. If youassigned the varaible "seven" the value 7 then wrote the string "seven = 7+1" the variable "seven" would no longer eguate to 7, but it would be assigned the value 8. Variables are useful in many ways. They make can be used to make the same expression produce different results, make using large expressions simpler and they make it easier for humans to understand and interpret the function of code.

      Strings
      </div>
    <div class="information">
     <p>
     A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. A string can be opened with either single or double quotes but it must be closed witht the same quotes that open it. Using both types of quotes allows for one to be contained within the other without ending the string. A string creates a container for text. If you were to run the expression 2 + 2 your result would be 4. If you created two strings with the digits, "2" + "2", the result would be 2 2.

    <div class="information">
     <p>
     Each character in a string has a value assigned to it's place. This begins at the left opening quote with the position zero and continues until the string is closed. This can make it easier to find a particular character in a string or select a substring.

        A function is a piece of code that takes input (a sting, a number etc.) runs it through a defined set of steps and returns output. A function is created with the keyword def wich is used to define the function name, Parameters are assigned to the function as a place holder for input. A return statement is required to output data. Functions save time and effort by performing repitious tasks without requiring repitious programming.

    <div class="information">
        IN Python the equals sign (=) does not have the same meaning as in mathematics. To express equality one uses two equals signs as one would signify assignment of value. An exclamation point before an equals sign signifies something is not equal to something else. The greater than and less than signs function as they do in mathematics.

    <div class="information">
        When code doesn't work finding and correcting errors is called debugging. To debug code you can begin by examining error mesages that appear when programs crash. Python taceback errors display what went wrong and in which line the error occured.You can also work from example code and modify it step by step to fit your needs. If using example code it's important to make sure that code works. If your code doesn't crash but still behaves unexpectedly you can use print stements to ee where errors exist in your code. Once you have a functioning version of your code save it before making any further changes. Having older function versions allows you to compare when problems arise.

    <div class="information">
        HTTP uses a client/server setup to communicate between client machines that request data, and server machines which deliver data. There are static responses which include pre-written content, video, sound, and image files and dynamic responses which are created on demand by programs running on the server called web applications. When a client makes a request for a document this is called a “GET request”. The server then sends the requested data to the client. Examples of these responses could be a 404 status (not found), a css stylesheet, an entire website containing embedded images, or anything in between. Another type of request is called a "POST Request". This sends a message from a client to the server with instructions on what changes to make to whatever page specified. POST requests are used to update, change, or modify data server-side. For example, filling out a form on a web page and submitting it will instruct the server to write a new record to a connected database. It will then redirect to the main page, which will then issue a GET request to show the newly added record.

If the time is 7:00 now, then 8 hours later it will be 3:00. Usual addition would suggest that the later time should be 7+8=15, but this is not the answer because clock time "wraps around" every 12 hours; in 12-hour time, there is no "15 o'clock". Likewise, if the clock starts at 12:00 (noon) and 21 hours elapse, then the time will be 9:00 the next day, rather than 33:00.

While it's important to be sure that any user input is secure data and not malicious code, such as SQL injection, for the seurity of your application, you also want to be sure to avoid user annoyances like spam posts and bots. If there is an error in user input it's important to include a specific error message detailing what the invalid entry was so that the input can be corrected.

        HTML Templates
    </div>
    <div class="information">
        HTML templates exist to allow one to reuse code over and over without the need to rewrite it. Templates can be used for things such as headers on a web page to apply identical styles and content to various pages without having to rewrite the code needed for those elements. Using templates also streamlines the process of writing in two lanuages in one editor allowing tools like syntax highlighting to still function.

        Template Inheritence 
    </div>
    <div class="information">
        Template inheritance allows you to build a base “scaffolding” template that contains all the common elements of your site and defines blocks that child templates can override. This approach maximizes code reuse and makes it easy to add items to shared content areas, such as section-wide navigation.
